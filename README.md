## Work on state-of-the-art Deep Learning neural networks to help to improve the performance of an object detection model based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
## The model is used to automatically inspect electronic components on circuit boards. 

### This work will include:

- Learning about the theory of CNNs for object detection
- Data collection & extension of an existing data set with a semi-automatic labelling tool
- Training of a CNN model with the extended data
- Evaluation of model performance (Accuracy, Precision, Recall etc. ) and comparing it to previous models
- Development of an additional classification module to analyse the connectivity of the electric components.
